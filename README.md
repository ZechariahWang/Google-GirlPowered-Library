# Girl Powered Framework

The programming framework used at the 2024 Girl Powered Workshop hosted by Western Mechatronics. Hosted in collaboration with the University of Calgary and sponsored by Google.

Utilized by 160+ participants and 32 teams (2024 workshop). Specifically designed for armature control, using proportional integral derivative controllers (PID) with minimal sensor readings (No IMUs, external rotation sensors, or other forms of input). The only fundamental source of data was embedded motor encoder readings.
